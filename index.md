## Welcome

This page is used to give CODA project members access to the visualizations of the citation network so they can help vildate the results 

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.
